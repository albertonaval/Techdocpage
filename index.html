              <strong>Blockchain defined:</strong>Blockchain is a shared,
              immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording
              transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset
              can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible
              (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually
              anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain
              network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Why blockchain is important</strong>Business runs on
              information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is,
              the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information
              because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent
              information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed
              only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can
              track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And
              because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all
              details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater
              confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.
            </p>
          </article>
          <ul>
            Key elements of a blockchain
            <li>
              <h4>Distributed ledger technology</h4>
              <p>
                All network participants have access to the distributed ledger
                and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared
                ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the
                duplication of effort that’s typical of traditional business
                networks.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Immutables records</h4>
              <p>
                No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after
                it’s been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record
                includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse
                the error, and both transactions are then visible.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Smart contracts</h4>
              <p>
                To speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract
                — is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically. A
                smart contract can define conditions for corporate bond
                transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and
                much more.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How blockchain works</h3>
          <h4>
            As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data
          </h4>
          <p>
            Those transactions show the movement of an asset that can be
            tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual). The data block
            can record the information of your choice: who, what, when, where,
            how much and even the condition — such as the temperature of a food
            shipment.
          </p>
          <h4>Each block is connected to the ones before and after it</h4>
          <p>
            These blocks form a chain of data as an asset moves from place to
            place or ownership changes hands. The blocks confirm the exact time
            and sequence of transactions, and the blocks link securely together
            to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted
            between two existing blocks.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain: a
            blockchain
          </h4>
          <p>
            Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous
            block and hence the entire blockchain. This renders the blockchain
            tamper-evident, delivering the key strength of immutability. This
            removes the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor — and
            builds a ledger of transactions you and other network members can
            trust.

          <p>
            <strong>What needs to change:</strong>Operations often waste effort
            on duplicate record keeping and third-party validations.
            Record-keeping systems can be vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks.
            Limited transparency can slow data verification. And with the
            arrival of IoT, transaction volumes have exploded. All of this slows
            business, drains the bottom line — and means we need a better way.
            Enter blockchain.
          </p>
          <h4>Greater trust</h4>
          <p>
            With blockchain, as a member of a members-only network, you can rest
            assured that you are receiving accurate and timely data, and that
            your confidential blockchain records will be shared only with
            network members to whom you have specifically granted access.
          </p>
          <h4>Greater security</h4>
          <p>
            Consensus on data accuracy is required from all network members, and
            all validated transactions are immutable because they are recorded
            permanently. No one, not even a system administrator, can delete a
            transaction.
          </p>
          <h4>More efficiencies</h4>
          <p>
            With a distributed ledger that is shared among members of a network,
            time-wasting record reconciliations are eliminated. And to speed
            transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract — can be
            stored on the blockchain and executed automatically.

          <h3>
            There are several ways to build a blockchain network. They can be
            public, private, permissioned or built by a consortium
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Public blockchain networks</h4>
              <p>
                A public blockchain is one that anyone can join and participate
                in, such as Bitcoin. Drawbacks might include substantial
                computational power required, little or no privacy for
                transactions, and weak security. These are important
                considerations for enterprise use cases of blockchain.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Private blockchain networks</h4>
              <p>
                A private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain
                network, is a decentralized peer-to-peer network. However, one
                organization governs the network, controlling who is allowed to
                participate, execute a consensus protocol and maintain the
                shared ledger. Depending on the use case, this can significantly
                boost trust and confidence between participants. A private
                blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and even be
                hosted on premises.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Permissioned blockchain networks</h4>
              <p>
                Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up
                a permissioned blockchain network. It is important to note that
                public blockchain networks can also be permissioned. This places
                restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and
                in what transactions. Participants need to obtain an invitation
                or permission to join.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Consortium blockchain</h4>
              <p>
                Multiple organizations can share the responsibilities of
                maintaining a blockchain. These pre-selected organizations
                determine who may submit transactions or access the data. A
                consortium blockchain is ideal for business when all
                participants need to be permissioned and have a shared
                responsibility for the blockchain.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Blockchain security</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Risk management systems for blockchain networks</h4>
              <p>
                When building an enterprise blockchain application, it’s
                important to have a comprehensive security strategy that uses
                cybersecurity frameworks, assurance services and best practices
                to reduce risks against attacks and fraud.
